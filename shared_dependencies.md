Shared Dependencies:

1. Gemini Terminal Emulator: All the extensions are dependent on the Gemini terminal emulator. They all need it to be installed and running for them to function.
   Example: The Rename extension uses the Gemini terminal emulator to display its interface and receive user input.

2. Extension Interface: All the extensions share a common interface for interacting with the Gemini terminal. This includes methods for opening the extension, closing the extension, and interacting with the extension.
   Example: The Multimodal extension uses the common interface to open, close, and interact with the Gemini terminal.

3. Sudo Control: All the extensions require sudo control to perform their tasks. This is a shared dependency as it is required by all the extensions.
   Example: The Create Env extension uses sudo control to create new environments.

4. File and Folder Names: The Rename extension, Multimodal extension, Create Env extension, and Create Software extension all interact with files and folders. They share the dependency of needing the names of these files and folders to perform their tasks.
   Example: The Create Software extension needs the names of files and folders to create new software projects.

5. Environment Names: The Create Env extension and Create Software extension both require the names of environments. This is a shared dependency between these two extensions.
   Example: The Create Software extension needs the names of environments to create new software projects in specific environments.

6. Software Names: The Create Software extension requires the names of software. This is a shared dependency with the Copilot extension, which may also need to know the names of software to assist in writing code.
   Example: The Copilot extension uses the names of software to assist in writing code for those software projects.

7. DOM Elements: All the extensions will interact with the Gemini terminal through DOM elements. These could include the status bar, icons, and text input fields. The id names of these DOM elements are shared dependencies.
   Example: The Rename extension interacts with the Gemini terminal through DOM elements like the status bar and text input fields.

8. Message Names: All the extensions will likely use messages to communicate with the Gemini terminal and with each other. The names of these messages are shared dependencies.
   Example: The Multimodal extension uses messages to communicate with the Gemini terminal and other extensions.

9. Function Names: All the extensions will have functions for performing their tasks. The names of these functions are shared dependencies, as they will need to be unique to avoid conflicts.
   Example: The Create Env extension has unique function names for creating new environments to avoid conflicts with other extensions.
